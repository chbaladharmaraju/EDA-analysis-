            "**Overall Impression:**\n",
            "Your resume is highly optimized for a Full Stack Developer role. You've clearly listed relevant skills, demonstrated them through impressive projects, and have a solid educational background. The variety of technologies you've used (React, Django, Node.js, multiple databases) shows strong breadth and practical experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Strengths for a Full Stack Developer Role:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Comprehensive Skillset:** You've hit all the major points for full-stack development:\n",
            "    *   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Tailwind CSS (Excellent combination).\n",
            "    *   **Backend:** Django, Node.js, RESTful APIs (Covers both Python and JavaScript backends).\n",
            "    *   **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite (Covers both SQL and NoSQL).\n",
            "    *   **Core CS:** Data Structures & Algorithms, OOP, DBMS, OS, Computer Networks (Crucial foundational knowledge).\n",
            "    *   **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code (Essential for collaborative development).\n",
            "2.  **Project-Driven Proof:** Your projects are directly relevant and demonstrate your ability to build complete applications:\n",
            "    *   \"Movie Search Application\" and \"CrizScore\" showcase strong frontend and API integration.\n",
            "    *   \"Social Media Web Application\" is a fantastic full-stack project, demonstrating user authentication, CRUD operations, and database design with Django.\n",
            "3.  **Keyword Optimization:** You've naturally integrated a high density of full-stack keywords throughout your skills and project descriptions. This makes your resume highly scannable by ATS.\n",
            "4.  **Action Verbs & Quantification:** You use strong action verbs (Developed, Implemented, Designed, Built) and even some quantification (\"Improved model accuracy by 25%\"), which is great.\n",
            "5.  **Clean Structure:** The resume is well-organized, making it easy for both ATS and human recruiters to find information quickly.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Minor Areas for Improvement & Considerations (To get to 100% or improve human readability):**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Symbol Interpretation (`/gtb`, `/♀nedn`):** The symbols `/gtb` (presumably for GitHub) and `/♀nedn` (for LinkedIn) are not universally recognized by all ATS systems and can look like errors to a human reader.\n",
            "    *   **Recommendation:** Use standard text like \"GitHub\" and \"LinkedIn\" with clickable hyperlinks (if submitting a PDF) or just the URLs. For example:\n",
            "        *   `LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`\n",
            "        *   `GitHub: github.com/yourprofile`\n",
            "2.  **Salesforce Certification Relevance:** The \"Salesforce Certified Agentforce Specialist\" certification is excellent, but for a generic \"Full Stack Developer\" role, it's not a primary keyword match. ATS will score it as a skill, but it won't add points *specifically* for \"Full Stack\" unless Salesforce development is part of the job description.\n",
            "    *   **Recommendation:** Keep it, as it shows your ability to learn and certify, but be aware it's more of a bonus than a core full-stack skill. If applying to a Salesforce-specific full-stack role, this would be a major plus.\n",
            "3.  **Deployment & Cloud Experience (Optional but beneficial):** While you use various tech stacks, mentioning any experience with deploying applications (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, basic AWS/Azure/GCP services like S3, EC2, Lambda for backend) would strengthen your full-stack profile even further, as deployment is a key aspect.\n",
            "4.  **Testing Experience (Optional):** Mentioning if you have any experience with unit testing, integration testing, or end-to-end testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Pytest) would be a good addition for more senior full-stack roles.\n",
            "5.  **Education Timeline Clarification:** \"B.Tech in Computer Science (AI & DS) 2024 – Present\" and \"Diploma in Computer Engineering 2021 – 2024\" means you just finished your diploma and started your B.Tech this year. This is perfectly fine, but some recruiters might briefly glance and see \"2024-Present\" and assume you're a first-year student with a very strong project portfolio (which is impressive!). No change needed, just an observation.\n",
            "6.  **\"Human Pose Estimation\" Project:** While it demonstrates strong Python, ML, and problem-solving, it's slightly less \"full-stack\" than your other projects. You could briefly mention any web interface or API you built around it if applicable, to tie it more directly to full-stack. Otherwise, it still showcases valuable technical skills.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**To Maximize Impact (beyond ATS):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Tailor for Each Role:** Always review the specific job description for keywords. If a JD emphasizes a particular framework (e.g., \"experience with Redux in React,\" or \"familiarity with Docker\"), ensure those keywords are present if you have the experience.\n",
            "*   **Networking:** Leverage your LinkedIn profile, ensuring it mirrors your resume and includes recommendations.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Bala, your resume is exceptionally strong for a Full Stack Developer. You've done a fantastic job presenting your skills and experience. Addressing the minor formatting issues with the symbols would make it even more robust for all ATS and human reviewers. Keep up the great work!\n"
